This is my attempt to create a game of chess in Ruby. I know this is a common newbie program, but I've never studied how you would do it. So I'm doing it my way then I'm going to look at other peoples examples and see how mine holds up.

Also I'm terrible at writing tests, and knowing what tests to write, so I'm going to write the whole program then comment out one line in each method so that any test I write will fail but I'll have help with what tests I should write. After writing all the failing tests I'll uncomment the code and see what happens.
